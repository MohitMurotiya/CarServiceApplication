## üéØ About

I have started this project with the purpose of learning how to structure a Web App using MERN stack.

- Created REST-APIs with NodeJS & Express.
- Created Front-End using React.
- Used MongoDB Atlas for database.
- Used JWT for Authentication and Authorization.
- After Login Each User is route according to his/her role and will able to see only his/her functionalities only. And If he tries to access with URL he‚Äôll be not able to do it.
- There are 3 Roles ADMIN, MECHANIC & CUSTOMER.
- For more Informatiom about the [functionalities](https://github.com/MohitMurotiya/CarServiceApplication/blob/master/Documentation) of each role.

  git clone https://github.com/MohitMurotiya/CarServiceApplication.git
```
- Go to the Front-End project directory

```
- To Run the [Font-End](https://github.com/MohitMurotiya/CarServiceApplication/blob/master/Client/car-wash-system/README.md) check this.

### For Back-End
- Create a account in [Atlas](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login)
- Deploy a free tier Cluster and create a Database.

#### Configure your Database with NodeJs

- Go to the Back-End project directory

```bash
  cd Server
```
- There are 4 Microservices
- Inside each Microservice a dbConfig.js file is there in config folder. Inside that you have to provide your database credentials.
- Install dependencies for each Microservice (Admin, Customer, Mechaninc, Order).

```bash
  cd Admin
```

```bash
  npm install
```
- Start the server of all Microservices.

```bash
  node Server.js
```

- For the ADMIN access you need to insert a record mannually in the members database as a role ADMIN.
